# Printemps Érable Corpus Exploration (PhD Thesis) - Shiny Application

This interactive web application (`Shiny App`) allows you to explore a journalistic corpus compiled as part of the PhD thesis by **Davide Pulizzotto**. **The application was built by Davide Pulizzotto.** The corpus focuses on the events of the **Printemps érable**, the Quebec student crisis of 2012.

## About the Thesis

The corpus and the underlying analyses presented in this application are drawn from the thesis titled:
***Computational Semiotics between Narrativity and Machine Learning: A Proof-Of-Concept with a Journalistic Corpus on the Printemps Érable***.
*(Original French Title: La sémiotique computationelle entre narrativité et apprentissage automatique : une démonstration de faisabilité avec un corpus journalistique à propos du printemps érable)*

This application provides access to a portion of the research results from this thesis, serving as an assistive tool for exploring the corpus which was processed using the analysis pipeline developed during the doctoral research.

## Application Features

The application offers the following exploration possibilities:

1.  **Corpus Article Exploration:** Navigate and consult individual articles within the journalistic corpus.
2.  **Detected Semantic Component Exploration:** Discover and analyze the semantic elements identified within the corpus through computational processing.

**Important Note:** Several functions available in the 'Composantes sémantiques' (Semantic Components) tab are currently in **BETA** version (potentially including Correspondence Analysis, Information Retrieval, etc.). Their behaviour or presentation may be subject to change.
